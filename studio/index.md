Each year my studio comprises 20 to 30 students, including elementary, intermediate, and advanced students of a variety of ages and with many different musical goals and backgrounds. Regardless of age or ability, I believe that music is vital to the human spirit, and that a music education has the power to enhance one’s intellect, imagination, and enjoyment of life in ways that few disciplines can. 

Having worked with [professionals](http://www.yukinumata.com), collegiate musicians, and children in [universities](http://www.furman.edu), [conservatories](http://ccm.uc.edu), and community music schools, I have seen how playing the piano engages more than just 88 keys: it activates the body, the mind, and the imagination.  When we engage with music—whether through listening, performing, dancing, singing, or analyzing—we sharpen countless skills, some of which we aren’t even aware of until we find ourselves applying them to disciplines other than music.
