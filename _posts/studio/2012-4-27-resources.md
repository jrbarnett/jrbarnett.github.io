##Repertoire and Materials
Sheet music is available from a variety of sources online ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com), [Piano at Pepper](http://www.pianoatpepper.com/) and [JW Pepper](http://www.jwpepper.com/sheet-music/piano-sheet-music.jsp)) and in the Buffalo area ([Illos Pianos](http://www.illos.com)). On occassion, sheet music is available for free through the [Interational Music Score Library Project](http://imslp.org). I am more than happy to purchase materials directly and send you a bill for the materials at-cost (including shipping, if applicable). 

In addition to their music, students should bring a notebook to every lesson so  that I can record practice notes, relay messages, and keep track of our progress and goals. Students (and parents) may also use this notebook for journaling practice habits, asking questions, or generally expressing their musical aspirations. 

Students should invest in a metronome to insure quality practicing. [Metronome apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pro-metronome-tempo-keeping/id477960671?mt=8) are available on your smartphone, and quality, affordable metronomes are [available online](http://www.amazon.com/Matrix-MR600-Deluxe-Metronome/dp/B0002F6ZJS/ref=sr_1_12?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=1432250811&sr=1-12).  

##Piano Maintenance

In the Buffalo area, we have a number of exceptional piano stores and repair technicians. For piano maintenance, I highly recommend both [Sharon Mok](http://www.music.buffalo.edu/faculty/staff) at the University at Buffalo and [Illos Pianos](http://www.illos.com).


##Music Theory Resources
Theory tutorials, flash cards, ear-training drills, staff paper, etc. are available at [musictheory.net](www.musictheory.net). There are number of wonderful iPhone and Android apps as well.
