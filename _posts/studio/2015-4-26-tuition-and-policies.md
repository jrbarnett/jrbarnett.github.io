Monthly tuition is due at the first lesson of each month and can be paid via check, cash, [or](paypal.com) [electronically](https://venmo.com). I will issue a monthly invoice and receipt electronically. Families with two or more students will receive a $5 discount per student.

Tuition encompasses lesson time and overhead costs, which include materials, recitals, and piano maintenance. 

Lesson lengths are recommended below and vary by student age, level, and budget.

<h2>
	<a name='attendance'>Attendance and Cancellation</a>
</h2>
Regular attendance is expected and necessary to make progress. If a lesson must be cancelled, please contact me via email, text message, or phone call as soon as possible. If I must cancel a lesson, I will make it up as soon as possible and at your convenience 

<h2>
	<a name='practicing'>
		Practicing
	</a>
</h2>
Becoming a great pianist requires regular, quality practice at home. Lessons focus on the development of effective practice skills that build not only strength, coordination and musicality, but also focus, self-discipline, and the ability to solve problems - skills that help us all be more productive humans. 

It is essential that young students, especially beginners, receive active and positive parental involvement outside of the lesson time. Parents are invited to attend lessons and encouraged to ask questions or share observations about their childâ€™s progress.

<h2>
	Performance Opportunities
</h2>
<a name ="performance"></a>

1. Recitals: All students ages 18 and under should plan to perform in a minimum of two studio recitals each year. Adult students have the option to participate. All recitals are open to the public; family and friends are welcome.
